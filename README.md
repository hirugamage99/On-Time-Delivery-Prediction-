# Logistical Efficiency Enhancement through On-Time Delivery Prediction (2023-24)

## Project Overview
This project aims to enhance logistical efficiency by creating a high-performance machine learning classification model to predict on-time deliveries for a shipping company. The model is designed to optimize supply chain operations by accurately forecasting delivery times.

## Features
- **Machine Learning Model**: Developed a classification model to predict the likelihood of on-time deliveries.
- **Web Deployment**: Deployed the model using Flask and created a user-friendly web interface for displaying predictions and model results.
- **Supply Chain Optimization**: The predictions help optimize the company's logistical and supply chain processes by identifying potential delays in real-time.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Languages**: Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Libraries**:
  - **Flask**: For deploying the web application.
  - **scikit-learn**: For building and evaluating the machine learning model.
  - **pandas**: For data manipulation and processing.
  - **matplotlib**: For visualizing results.
  - **numpy**: For numerical computations.
